# Configuration for rcm

# According to the BUGS section under `man 7 rcm`, it's recommended
# to set the HOSTNAME manually for MacOS.
#
HOSTNAME="tarfu"

# Never symlink these files:
#
COPY_ALWAYS="ssh/id_* ssh/dreamhost* ssh/home* ssh/github* ssh/known_hosts ssh/env*"

# rcm will ignore these:
#
EXCLUDES="README*"

# default tags
#
TAGS="work git perl ssh tmux zsh"

# Will be symlinked instead of descended. bin/ and ssh/ are not present
# in this list because we want them to be standard directories in ~
# with symlinked files inside..
#
SYMLINK_DIRS="config oh-my-zsh grc vim"

# name these as listed. do not prepend a "."
#
UNDOTTED="bin tools"
